# Community Postal Service


Have you ever wanted to get an ElePHPant from you to someone else? Or a Gopher? Or a Wapuu? 

This Website wants to connect people of the community or of different communities that are willing to take your precious item with them and deliver it. A community-driven Postal Service.

## What is needed?

Currently multiple things are needed:

* Some people to create a Web-Interface that allows people to register and enter at which community events they are throughout the year
* Some people to create an API that allows to find the shortest and fastest path between two of these community-members
* People that write Plugins for different backends that make it easy to register for different community-events
* Someone that sponsors the required Servers etc.
* People that trade their precious community-items ;-)
